This is a book from my college, VJTI. It was good, but I didn't read it completely. Doing it now.

Book link: https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60721505-database-system-concepts-7th-edition

I'm not going to do everything in the book, just parts, like:
1. History and Computer Science of databases and query languages
2. Learning SQL
3. Learning about physical infrastructure that supports DBs, like discs, RAID etc.
4. Database design
5. Some parts on analytics.
